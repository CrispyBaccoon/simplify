# simpl.fyi

A browser extension that brings the simplicity of Google Inbox to Gmail.

## What is this fork?

<kbd>command + \\</kbd> to toggle the menu instead of the existing shortcut. Maybe helpful if you're used to Notion. That's the only change.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `edit Jun 26, 19` ‚Äî I switched my text editor to VS Code and all the shortcuts are the same as Notion's lmao. I've come to the conclusion that Notion's keyboard shortcuts are probably a product of Notion being written using using VS Code. ü§î

You can also use <kbd>control + \\</kbd> if you like.

I'll merge updates from @[leggett](https://github.com/leggett)'s [Simplify repo](https://github.com/leggett/simplify) every once and a while probably. Message me on twitter if u need a critical update or st but idk who even reads the readmes of forks lmao.

## How to install

[Download the repo](https://github.com/mwvd/simplify/archive/master.zip) then load the `gmail` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## Who made Simplify
