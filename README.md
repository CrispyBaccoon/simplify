# simpl.fyi

A browser extension that brings the simplicity of Google Inbox to Gmail.

## What is this fork?
`command + \` to toggle the menu instead of the existing shortcut. Maybe helpful if you're used to Notion. That's the only change.

You can also use `control + \` if you like.

I'll merge updates from @[leggett](https://github.com/leggett)'s [Simplify repo](https://github.com/leggett/simplify) every once and a while probably. Message me on twitter if u need a critical update or st but idk who even reads the readmes of forks lmao.

## How to install
[Download the repo](https://github.com/mwvd/simplify/archive/master.zip) then load the `gmail` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## Who made Simplify
Simplify was made by [Michael Leggett](https://leggett.org).

## Merging between forks
```
git remote add og git://github.com/og/repo.git ✔️

git pull og master
git push origin
```
